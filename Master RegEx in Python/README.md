# Mastering RegEx in Python

This repository houses the code used in our 'Mastering RegEx in Python' YouTube series. The series aims to unravel the mysteries of Regular Expressions or RegEx in Python, a highly specialized programming language embedded within Python and made accessible through the 're' module.

## What is RegEx?

Regular Expressions (RegEx) is a powerful tool used for manipulating and handling text data. RegEx allows us to define patterns to match specific characters, words, or patterns within a text, hence providing a mechanism to search, manipulate, and manage text data efficiently.

## Episode 1: Dot Patterns

In the first episode, we're exploring one of the most fundamental RegEx pattern - the Dot Patterns.

Dot Patterns are denoted by a '.' and can match any character except newline. Here's an example of a simple dot pattern:

```python
import re

pattern = r'.ox'

string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

result = re.search(pattern, string)

print(result.group())
```

In this code, we defined a pattern to match any character followed by the string 'ox'. When we run a search for this pattern in our example string, the match we find is 'fox'.

Stay tuned for upcoming episodes as we dive deeper into the various pattern methods in RegEx. Happy Coding!
